We created all of our visual assets (animals, backgrounds, tree images, etc. ourselves. It took a while and we are very proud. Christine made our many tree images, Jensen made and animated our animals, and Hailey made our backgrounds).

For music and sound effects we used:
-Hateno Village (The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild OST) created by Manaka Kataoka, Yasuaki Iwata, and Hajime Wakai
-Plant Growing Sound Effect by Free Sound Effects
-Plant Growing - Sound Effect (HD) by House of Sound Effects
-Bush Rustling Sound | Bush Rustling Sound Effect | Free Sound Effects by BridgeSound
